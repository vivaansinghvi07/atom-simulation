make a grid, with each square in the grid representing a center of mass and a given mass amount for all points falling in that square
for each square in each grid of varying complexity, determine the aforementioned traits
for points that are too close to be abstracted away, consider the exact points for calculations
we can do this by creating some sort of list (maybe linked list) to store particles in a given location -- this might be too computationally expensive
